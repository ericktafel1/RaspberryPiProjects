# Mobile Raspberry Pi Hacking Machine

Welcome to the repository for the Mobile Raspberry Pi Hacking Machine â€“ your gateway to a portable cybersecurity adventure! ðŸš€

## Project Overview
### Components:
- Raspberry Pi Model: 3 B+
- Accessories: Bluetooth mini keyboard + trackpad, wireless adapter, LCD touchscreen
- Power: Charging bank for on-the-go hacking missions

### The Break: Finding the Touchscreen Driver
After months of crafting the perfect mobile hacking setup, I hit a snag â€“ the elusive touchscreen driver. Frustration peaked, so I took a breatherâ€”a wise move, as it turns out. Sometimes, a step back is all it takes.

After my hiatus, I found the **right driver** for the LCD screen. Pure joy! Now, our hacking machine boasts a fully functional touchscreen, amplifying its cool factor.


## Installation Guide
### 1. Get the Kali Image
Visit [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm) to grab the latest ARM image.

### 2. Format the SD Card
Use the [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) for a clean slate.

### 3. Write the Image
Employ [Win32DiskImager](https://raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-operating-systems/win32diskimager) to burn Kali onto your SD card.

### 4. LCD Driver Magic
For the LCD driver, head to [LCD-show-kali](https://github.com/lcdwiki/LCD-show-kali
) and follow their wizardry.


## The Result
Although everything was working perfectly, I couldn't help but think I could use my RPi for something more useful. After all this device does the same as my laptop but is much smaller. So I am now playing with the idea of transforming it into a PiHole to block ads and trackers! I will post that write-up soon.
